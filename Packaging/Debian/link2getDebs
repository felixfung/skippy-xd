Looking for a deb?

Go to https://github.com/tonywhatever/deb_build4skippy

There in the README.md you find:

    a link to download an installable debian binary.

    two very simple recipes to create your very own installable
    debian-binary if you so wish.

Distros supported:

    Debian: will also work for Devuan, MX-Linux, Antix, SpiralLinux etc.
    Architecture: i386 and amd64

    Ubuntu: will work for all flavours/editions of
    Ubuntu and Linux Mint
    Architecture: amd64

All available binaries have been tested and work as they should.
